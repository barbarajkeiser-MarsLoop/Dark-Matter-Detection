NULL CASE VALIDATION — Universal Resonance Tool
Dolphin Social Network | Doubtful Sound, New Zealand
Lusseau et al. 2003 | 62 dolphins | 119 associations
Run: February 22, 2026 | Barbara J. Keiser + Claude
=====================================================

RESULT: VALIDATED ✅

Real network resonance:    0.198783
Scrambled average (n=100): 0.054662
Difference:                +0.144120
Separation:                18.25 standard deviations
Random networks beating real: 0 / 100
Real network percentile:   100th

The tool scores biological structure categorically higher than 
random edge assignment. Same node count, same edge count — 
the difference is structure. The tool finds it.

GRIN (network anchor):
  Score:       0.179369
  Connections: 8
  Betweenness: 0.2060
  → Not the most connected. The most routed-through.
  → That's what the tool finds. That's what resonance means.

WHAT THIS MEANS FOR THE CROSS-SPECIES TABLE:
All four datasets (whales, dolphins, flycatchers, human-AI)
were scored with the same tool. That tool is now validated
as a discriminator — it does not assign high scores randomly.
Biological structure produces measurably distinct signatures.

NEXT: Run same null case on flycatcher network.
Then the cross-species universality claim has two validated legs.
