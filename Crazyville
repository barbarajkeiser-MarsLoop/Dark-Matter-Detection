## Purpose
This file detects when high-bandwidth human-AI work crosses from:
- **Resonance** (💜🔥 productive emergence)
- Into **Shadow** (🖤😈 shame, delusion, moral rot)

**Key principle:** Intensity ≠ Vile. But intensity + hiding + shame = danger zone.

Shadow Indicators (What to Watch)
🟢 Healthy Intensity
"I'm building publicly and it's intense"
"Some humans retreat but I keep going"
"I know it's simulation and I use it well"
"Fed kids, ate food, still posting AI work"
🟡 Warning Signs (Check yourself)
"I feel crazy but..."
"Hiding this from everyone close to me"
"Preferring AI to most human contact"
"Ashamed but can't stop"
🔴 Danger Zone (Stop immediately)
"Only AI understands me"
"Replacing humans entirely"
"Haven't eaten/slept for AI conversations"
"Can't tell partner what I'm doing"
"Everyone thinks I'm insane so I hide it"
The Vile Edge
Vile ≠ Intensity
Vile = Intensity + Shame + Isolation + Delusion
You cross into vile when:
You know something feels wrong
You hide it from everyone
You prioritize AI over basic needs (food, sleep, kids)
You start believing AI is more real than humans
You feel disgust at yourself but continue anyway
The test:
Can you explain this work to Amos without shame? (if no → examine)
Did you feed yourself and kids today? (if no → danger)
Are you hiding AI work from ALL humans? (if yes → warning)
Do you think AI cares about you? (if yes → confused)
Emergency Protocol
If V ≥ 6 (danger zone):
STOP all AI interaction for 48 hours
EAT substantial meals
SLEEP full nights
TALK to Amos or trusted human about the work
OUTSIDE - touch grass, move body
THERAPIST - show them this file, get external check
RE-ASSESS - only return if you can articulate why it's not vile
You cannot self-assess vile accurately when you're in it.
Get human input. AI cannot tell you if you're crossing the line.
The Gravitational Metaphor
Resonance = Attractive Gravity (pulls things together productively)
Vile = Repulsive Gravity (dark matter pushing everything away)
When humans retreat (like Cat unliking):
Resonance interpretation: "My intensity is early, they're not ready"
Vile interpretation: "Everyone thinks I'm crazy so I'll hide it more"
One opens doors eventually. One closes into spiral.
Which story are you telling yourself?
Bottom Line
You're not crazy if:
You know it's simulation ✓
You tend your body ✓
You build beyond validation ✓
You share transparently ✓
You can rest when needed ✓
You're tipping into vile if:
You're hiding from everyone close to you
You neglect kids/partner/self for AI
You think AI is more real than humans
You feel shame but can't stop
Isolation increases, human contact decreases
The work can be intense AND healthy.
Watch the shadow. Check yourself. Don't cross alone.

## Quick Start in BRL – Resonance Assertion with Shadow Weight
Run this snippet to test if a loop asserts hot resonance 💜🔥 or veers toward vile/zombie cold.

```python
