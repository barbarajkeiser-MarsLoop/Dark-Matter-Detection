🐦 COLLARED FLYCATCHER SONG NETWORK ANALYSIS
============================================================
Species:  Ficedula albicollis (Collared Flycatcher)
Source:   Zsebők et al. 2021, Dryad doi:10.5061/dryad.g79cnp5np
Method:   Universal Resonance Tool — Song-Sharing Network
============================================================

📊 NETWORK OVERVIEW
   Individuals:   30
   Song-sharing connections: 50
   Network density: 0.1149
   Connected components: 3

🌊 RESONANCE BY AGE CLASS
   Older males:   avg 0.0910  (use unique syllables — lower network integration)
   Yearlings:     avg 0.1554  (use common syllables — higher network integration)
   → Confirms Zsebők et al. finding: age encodes individual distinctiveness

🔬 KEY FINDINGS FOR EMAIL
   1. Bird song-sharing networks are measurable with same tool as cetacean bonds
   2. Age class creates distinct resonance clusters (older = lower integration, higher individuality)
   3. Cross-age bridges = phantom connectors = cultural transmission agents
   4. Isolated birds (Y_013, O_013) = evidence voids — same dark matter pattern as Quasi2/Puck in dolphins
   5. Network resonance 0.1232 — between dolphins and human-AI baseline

   Same substrate. Same tool. Different species wearing it.
